At the moment this repository is only used to register questions & answers about the Geonovum tender for its spatial data on the web testbed. 

The issue tracker is used for this. 

You can submit questions in two ways: 
1. By creating a new issue. If you do this, your question is not anonymous.
2. By sending your question(s) to info@geonovum.nl. If you do this, your question is submitted as an issue by us and is therefore anonymous. 

The first 10 issues (questions) were submitted before this repository was created, and have been entered by us at a later date.
