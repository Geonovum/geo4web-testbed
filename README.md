## the testbed
Geonovum wants to know more about how to publish spatial data on the web in a usable manner. To this end we are organizing a testbed around these four research topics:
*	Research topic #1: Modern ways of spatial data publication
*	Research topic #2: A usable spatial data publication platform
*	Research topic #3: Crawlable spatial data using the ecosystem of the Web and Linked Data
*	Research topic #4: Spatial data on the web using the current SDI
